# My self-paced learning for Rust programming & mastery of Git version control system

### I'll be focusing on developing :-
 * DAP using Rust, Anchor, Solana mainly
 * Zed IDE ( Aves version ; my custom version of Zed IDE )


### RoadMap

1. *MAY-JUNE*: 
 - learning Rust development, building stong foundation & understand processes to best of my ability ( not only build something just to make it work ; this is my learning journey, not job/responsibily )
 - learn by building 

2. *JUNE/JULY-AUG*: 
 - develop on **superteam.earn** and earn bounties.
 - livestream Zed IDEs development

 ---will be updated regularly---
